            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h3>
                My name is Emil Dahl-Hansen, I'm a 22 year old software developer located in Sweden, originally born in Norway.<br>
                I have been developing software as a hobby for about 4 years in different fields, both back-end and front-end.<br><br>

                Before I started learning how to program, I enrolled at a technical institute in Sweden, with the direction of Civil Engineering.<br>
                The course I enrolled had programming as one of the base courses, there I learned how to compile and run some simple Java code.<br>
                Since I primarily studied math and physics, I tried applying that knowledge in programming and saw a whole new world open up.<br>
                This is what led to the change of career goals.<br><br>

                My strongsuits are being very design oriented around animations through math, specifically to create fun and interactive<br>
                elements by engineering the math used to animate those elements.<br>
                I also find myself effective at writing and integrating different systems that work together, hence why I decided to learn alot about game development.<br><br>

                Now my endgame goal is to find myself engineering data structures and programming interactive systems in a game studio.<br><br><br>

            <h1>My progress</h1>
            <h3>
                I started off in the Server and Database fields, where I developed an at-home dedicated server in Minecraft.<br>
                This involved setting up a database for storing player data to track their progress<br>
                as well as handling server side events for gameplay interactions.<br>
                (For reference, go to the Projects tab "Minecraft Server")<br><br>

                As I started feeling more familiar with the programming pipeline in Java, I went on to create some<br>
                smaller projects where I interfaced with new and unfamiliar APIs.<br>
                These projects were meant to help me better understand how the Java syntax works.<br>
                Below are a few tools i made during this time.<br>
                A rewrap of minecrafts server chat, allowing me to implement a live chat translator for people playing on my server.<br>
                A comunication bridge between discord and minecraft for server chats.<br>
                Some discord server tools like image grabbers and tools for easy lookups on statistics from databases I made.<br><br>

                After I had my java phase, I tried my hands on making games instead.<br>
                This phase started around August 2023, where I enrolled a game development school.<br>
                The course I took emphasized on touching all aspects of game development to learn how to make games independently.<br>
                Here I learned alot about the development pipeline for creating a game, and since I already had an invested interest in programming<br>
                I took extra time to learn how games are made from a programmers perspective and ended up learning alot, to the point where I released my own game on Steam.<br>
